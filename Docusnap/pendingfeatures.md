## UX / product

### Teach wizard — label non-recognition  (added 2026-07-30, owner; screenshot)
- **Symptom (live):** drawing the value box for **PO Date** on a Saltmarsh Seafoods PO reads the value
  `13/11/2026` correctly, but the wizard reports "**No label found here** — try the other direction, draw
  one, or continue without" even though the printed label **"Order Date"** sits immediately to the LEFT of
  the value. Same class as the DIAGNOSED-not-fixed teach-label miss in `HANDOVER_2026-07-29_EVENING.md`.
- **Leading causes (from the handover, not yet reproduced at the slice):** (1) `src/windows/teach/renderer.js:779/795`
  recompute a downscale `ds` that IGNORES `TEACH_NATIVE_CROP` (crop sent native at ds=1.0) → the label
  word-box coords are mis-scaled; (2) the wide label band left of the value includes the big heading text
  ("PURCHASE ORDER"/"Order No.") so region OCR loses the small "Order Date" caption; (3) mild page skew
  breaks the left/above label relocation.
- **Next:** reproduce the actual label-band slice (owner rule: look at the slice) → fix the read + the `ds`
  frame bug. Teach-renderer-mostly.

### ✓ SHIPPED — Teach wizard: only-current-box overlay + Straighten text button  (2026-07-30, owner)
- Overlay now draws ONLY the field being taught (removed the done-fields loop in `redrawCanvas`); the last
  box clears once the final field confirms (`advanceField` parks `fieldIndex` past the end → `curField()`
  undefined). Display-only — `state.results` untouched.
- The teach `∞` straighten control replaced with Review's icon + "Straighten" text button (`#tz-deskew`,
  auto-width; keeps the `.active` pressed style). `src/windows/teach/{renderer.js,index.html}`. Needs app reopen.

### Template Manager — Straighten button  (added 2026-07-30, owner)
- **Wanted:** a Straighten control in the Template Manager preview (same as Review/teach) so a tilted
  sample can be levelled before drawing/checking anchor→target boxes. `src/windows/settings/` (Template
  Viewer `#tpl-dock`) + reuse `get-page-deskew` + the AnchorLabel transform (as teach does).

### Template Manager — visualize + tighten anchor boxes  (added 2026-07-30, owner — EXPLORE)
- **Owner questions (answered inline in chat 2026-07-30):** do TM-drawn boxes validate on import? what is
  the TM for? should the drawn zones be VISIBLE on a doc (like Review's "show where it reads") so the user
  sees where the system snaps? what settings tighten a frequently-misfiring box?
- **Direction to design:** (1) a "show where it reads" overlay in the TM preview (reuse the Review overlay
  path + `template_mapper` located-zone output); (2) per-mapping tightness controls (padding/expansion,
  registration on/off, label-lock strictness, absolute-vs-relocate) surfaced per field; (3) a per-box
  test-on-this-sample readout (already partly in `recordMappingTest`). See the chat exploration for the
  full write-up + the FACT-checked answers on how mappings/anchors are actually used at extraction.

### ✓ SHIPPED — Import "couldn't be read" banner: details + dismiss  (2026-07-30)
The amber Import banner now (1) reworded "held for retry (not filed, not lost)"; (2) a **Details** toggle
lists each held doc + WHY (`documents.error_message`, via the existing `getStuckDocs`); (3) a **dismiss (×)**
per-session acknowledge that re-surfaces only when MORE docs fail (`_stuckDismissedAt`). Renderer + markup +
CSS only (`src/windows/main/{renderer.js,index.html}`); errored docs still hold at `status='error'` (never
lost) — dismiss is display-only. Needs an app reopen to render.

## Extraction / accuracy

### Cross-contamination residual — Stage-2 `_qualify_against_format` — DO-NOTHING (gary+Oracle, 2026-07-30)
- **Resolved understanding (Oracle traced it):** the Stage-4.5 fix (`SHAPE_WITHHOLD_SUPPLIER_SCOPED`, default
  ON, engine.py:4421/4631) closes the keyword/rigid path. The feared Stage-2 `anchor_crop` null is **largely
  already handled**: `method='anchor_crop'` is set at `anchor.py:586` only AFTER passing `_qualify_against_format`
  at `582`; a clean stranger crop is nulled at **582** (the ENTRY to the relocate/registration recovery chain),
  and the located case is **already resurrected** at `anchor.py:1102-1104`/`1175-1177` by the same
  `_digit_free_on_digit_field`/`_partial_of_uniform_shape` predicates (flagged at Stage 4.5). So `anchor_crop`
  is NOT the danger the earlier note claimed.
- **The genuine residual is a NARROW sliver:** `method='anchor'` text-fallback (+`anchor_crop_recovered`) —
  label readable as a text line but NOT locatable as a box, relocate/registration failed, field `_xsupplier`.
- **Why DO-NOTHING (gary designed a fix; Oracle SIGN-OFF-W/COND → build DARK / fallback DO-NOTHING):** the fix
  (an `xsupplier_lookup` companion threaded to `anchor.py:1253`, keep-clean-reject-garble via the readability
  predicates) is sound + fail-safe (kept value → Stage-4.5 flag → never auto-files), BUT (a) reward is the
  narrow text-fallback sliver only; (b) a kept stranger ref WINS Tier A (engine.py:3552, `located` includes
  `'anchor'`) and DEMOTES a would-be keyword auto-file to a flagged review showing a WRONG value on disagreement
  — a real auto-file-rate regression (never a silent misfile); (c) the FIRING path is CORPUS-INERT (no taught
  anchors in the born-digital harness; real anchors belong to confirmed suppliers), so it can't be validated —
  Oracle's flip gate needs a constructed taught-anchor `_xsupplier` case on the BF_/KO_/… corpus. Not worth the
  demotion downside for a corpus-inert edge on a single-supplier install. Revisit only if a real firing case
  appears on a genuine multi-supplier install. gary's full design + Oracle's conditions (A corrected framing /
  B demotion pin / C taught-anchor gate / D `test_doctype_scoped_format_gate.py` direct-call short-circuit /
  E single `(entry,is_xsupplier)` closure) are in the 2026-07-30 chat.

### Letterhead cold-start supplier reader  (confirmed at scale 2026-07-29)
- **Symptom:** cold (first-contact, no learning) supplier identity reads only from a `Supplier:`/`Bill
  From:` caption. The born-digital demo batch measured **~8%** supplier accuracy cold — name-as-text
  letterheads, footer-only issuers, and text wordmarks all return null. Resolves once learning/templates
  exist, so it's a first-contact gap.
- **Fix direction:** the designed-but-unbuilt `letterhead.py` **suggestion-only** reader (largest text in
  the top band → issuer). Only ever needs to carry doc #1. See memory `project_issuer_band_and_letterhead`.

### S1 band-graduate — real fix (column/geometry-aware issuer window)
- **State:** S1 (`TEMPLATE_IDENTITY_BAND_GRADUATE`, commit `958229c`) is built DARK and proven **INERT**
  on its target: two-column `BILL FROM | BILL TO` layouts put the issuer name AFTER the "BILL TO"
  recipient marker in the linearized text, so `_issuer_hint_band` truncates it out → no shed.
- **Fix direction (deferred, gary+Oracle):** a column/geometry-aware issuer window, OR a `BILL FROM`-
  anchored corroboration window that excludes the recipient column (Oracle C2 is the constraint).
  Memory `project_autofile_s1_band_graduate_20260729`.

### delivery_number / worksheet ref completion  (reggie, 2026-07-29)
- delivery_number went 0% → **45%** after adding its `field_patterns` entry — still partial (more
  label/format coverage + the footer/three-party layouts). worksheet `reference_number` stays **30%** —
  the "Worksheet No"/"Job No" labels must be added at the **type-scoped** layer (preset override / ⊕
  teach), NOT the global `_REF_ROLE_CAPTIONS` seed (reggie: global would collide with `job_no` + blast
  every custom ref field).

### Set A warm cross-contamination  (found 2026-07-29)
- **Symptom:** loading the live learning snapshot DROPPED new-supplier ref accuracy **58% → 33%** on the
  demo Set A — suppliers that share nothing with the scanned data. Live learning bleeds onto strangers.
- **Prime suspects:** `findLogoMatch` is name-blind (phash-only) → a crest phash-collides with a live
  template; or a global/`__unknown__`-scope anchor; or a template fingerprint cross-match imposing a wrong
  fixed zone. Needs diagnosis (rerun the demo warm scorer + trace which live template/anchor matched).

### Digital ↔ scanned bleed (same supplier, divergent layout)
- **Confirmed (Set B warm):** a digital doc reusing a live name inherits the scanned identity (**supplier
  90%**) but the scanned template's field geometry doesn't fit the digital layout (**ref 29%**, held).
- **gary's least-invasive fix (deferred):** extend the `_located_at_taught_position` layout gate to
  **same-supplier** authoritative rigid reads (today cross-supplier only, `anchor.py:~1404`) → a taught
  absolute box fails toward review when its caption isn't at the taught position on a divergent layout.
  NOT a source-partition (that's wrong for production — same supplier should share learning).

## Type detection

### TYPE_PRESENCE_VETO — Slice 0 (band reader) + Slice 2 (auto-type cure)  (night 2026-07-28)
- Slice 0: a title-band PSM-11/upscale reader (`read_title_band`) to erase the veto's ~1.5–2.3%
  fail-safe false-holds and feed the cure. Slice 2: arm-the-refuse so legible titles auto-type correctly
  — **flip LAST**, after the identity fixes soak; biggest regression risk (needs a full-corpus per-doc
  type-flip gate). Memory `project_type_presence_veto_20260728`.

### Identity branding-primary separation  (night 2026-07-28, designed)
- Vellum/Larkspur phash collision (64-bit hash = LAYOUT not mark). Fix = branding-PRIMARY supplier
  separation, coarse recall-only, 256-bit mark corroborates. Vellum PDFs are image scans → Slice B
  (reprocess) cure; Option C (geometry) = fresh-import SUGGEST-only. Memory
  `project_identity_branding_primary_20260728`.

## Testing infrastructure

### Install preset types + total/line-item fields
- The live DB has only 5 doc types (invoice/sales_order/purchase_order/delivery_note/service_worksheet)
  and **no total/line-item field on any type**. Install credit_note/quote/statement/receipt (Settings →
  Add from catalog) + add a total field, then re-run `score_demo_digital.js` to cover all 9 demo types +
  money extraction (currently untestable). Can be scripted into a copy DB.

## Security / hardening

### Cython engine + arm fuses + asar rungs  (discussed 2026-07-29)
- The extraction engine ships as sourceless `.pyc` (a speed bump — bytecode decompiles back to
  near-source). `.pak` = Chromium resources (non-issue); most `.py` = third-party libs + thin entry
  shims. **Real upgrades (deferred, own session — build-chain change + full smoke):** Cython-compile the
  engine → native `.pyd`; arm the Electron fuses (`HARDEN_FUSES`, RunAsNode/inspector off); the deferred
  asar rungs B/D/F/E (bytenode/obfuscation). Plan: `docs/BUILD_HARDENING_PLAN_2026-07-26.md`. Framing:
  raise the bar, not "uncrackable" — the **licensing gate** is the commercial moat, not code secrecy.
